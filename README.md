The files in this project include attack files to be run within the Gauntlt framework (on a guntlt docker image). 

The attack files include checks for:

* Robots.txt
* Standard security headers
* Open ports
* HTTP Methods
* SQL Injection againsty vehicles (quote)
* HTTP -> HTTPS redirect
* SSL protocols and certificates

These tests are meant to monitor environments for changes, not scan for security vulnerabilities.

**Docker**

To build the docker file, run 
```
docker build -t latest .
```
To run via docker, run 
```
./securityTestCases.sh

For example, run from the command line:
```
env HOSTNAME=*hostname* /opt/gauntlt/bin/gauntlt -t *tag*
```
