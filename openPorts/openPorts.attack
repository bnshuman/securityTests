Feature: Nmap scan for open ports

Background:
	Given "nmap" is installed
	And the following environment variables:
    		| name | environment_variable_name |
    		| hostname | HOSTNAME |

@quote
Scenario: Verify the server is open on expected ports
	When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
		"""
		nmap -Pn <hostname>
		"""

	Then the output should contain:
		"""
		80/tcp   open  http
      		443/tcp  open  https
      		4443/tcp open  pharos
		"""
