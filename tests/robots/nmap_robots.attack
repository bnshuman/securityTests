Feature: nmap attacks to test for the presence of robots.txt 
  Background:
    Given "nmap" is installed
    And the following environment variables:
      | name       | environment_variable_name        |
      | hostname  | HOSTNAME |
      
   @perf
   Scenario: Detects robots.txt file on this host.
    When I launch an "nmap" attack with:
      """
      nmap -p80,443 --script http-robots.txt <hostname>
      """
    Then the output should contain:
      """
      | http-robots.txt:
      """
      
   @prod
