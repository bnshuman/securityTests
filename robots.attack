Feature: Look for robots.txt

Background:
  Given the "curl" command line binary is installed

Scenario: Verify robots.txt is received from a curl
  When I launch a "generic" attack with:
    """
    /opt/gauntlt/bin/gauntlt /opt/securityTests/robots/*.attack
    """
  Then the output should contain:
    """
    8 passed
    """
