Feature: Run sslyze against a target

Background:
  Given "sslyze" is installed
  And the following environment variables:
    | name     | environment_variable_name |
    | hostname | HOSTNAME |

Scenario: Ensure accepted SSLv3 Cipher Suites
  When I launch an "sslyze" attack with:
    """
    sslyze --sslv3 <hostname>:443

  Then the output should match:
